# Ryan Meaux E-portfolio

## Professional Self Assesment
Taking the Computer Science course has helped to shape my professional goals, by giving me a foundation to understand and practice Computer Science. The development of the Eportfolio provided me with an opportunity to demonstrate some of the things that I’ve managed to learn up to this point within the Computer Science program, thus allowing me to be able to shine a light on the areas that I feel are some of my most employable and best areas.  

Working in a team environment is almost inevitable within the computer science field, because of this, it’s very important to understand how to properly use products like GitHub. From the Computer Science program I have gotten the knowledge to be able to properly navigate and use GitHub. 

Communicating with the stakeholders in a project is important in project’s that use the waterfall or Agile Method. The importance of communication with the stakeholders provides the developers with a chance fully understand the requirements of what they’re developing. During the Computer Science program I’ve learned the basics of Agile or Waterfall and how to use each.  

Data Structures and algorithms are important to developers because they are the brains and engine of the software. During the computer sciences program, I’ve learned the basics of how to use, build, and deploy, both algorithms and days data structures. 

Database’s are important because they provide a location to store and pull data from they also serve as a medium where the UI communicates with the code. Within the computer sciences program I’ve learned how to properly manage and create one to one and one to many databases, both mongo and MySQL. 

The Artifacts fit together and demonstrate my knowledge and skill within all of the following areas; improving software, improving data structures, improving databases, improving security, and using data mining. Each section of the required upgrades requires the use of the other pieces of the upgrades. For example, when updating the app to use a 2FA method, it required the updating of data structures to hold other required data, it also required the updating of the databases to add columns to tables, and the expansion of the UI for use.

## Artifact One: Engineering

### Description
For Artificat One I chose to add onto the app that I developed from the ground up known as Weight Watcher. For this weeks enhancement, I decided to add a form of Two Factor Authentication. 

### List of upgrades
1. Updating SQL Table to include a column for users phone number. 
2. Created a new view for the execution of the Two Factor Authentication methods.
3. Created new methods in the Database Controller class to execute the Two Factor Authentication. 
4. Added a new line to the registration page to accept the phone number. 

### Demonstrated Skills
1. Create and design creative solutions to address security flaws. 
2. Demonstrate the ability to develop solutions to solve logic problems. 

### Justification And Success
For Artifact One the reason I chose to incorporate a form of Two Factor Authentication is to clearly demonstrate my ability to be able to create ideas to address security concerns. One of the biggest security concerns that exists currently is users sacrificing security for convenience, usually in the form of reusing the same password repeatedly. With Two Factor Authentication, an extra layer of security is given to the user that allows for the user to be able to easily move through the login process but would prove almost impossible for an individual with malicious intent to overcome. 
When creating the Two factor Authentication, I was planning on incorporating the Vonage Two Factor Authenticator package, but was quick to realize that Vonage and most other Two Factor Authentication packages cost money, so I questioned what I could do, and I finally decided on using a phone number as another form of authentication, because we typically keep our phone numbers to ourselves and typically don't share it online, and it's something that most people have memorized.
In order to solve the problem of incorporating such a design, I had
