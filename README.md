# Ryan Meaux E-portfolio

## Professional Self Assesment
Taking the Computer Science course has helped to shape my professional goals, by giving me a foundation to understand and practice Computer Science. The development of the Eportfolio provided me with an opportunity to demonstrate some of the things that I’ve managed to learn up to this point within the Computer Science program, thus allowing me to be able to shine a light on the areas that I feel are some of my most employable and best areas.  

Working in a team environment is almost inevitable within the computer science field, because of this, it’s very important to understand how to properly use products like GitHub. From the Computer Science program I have gotten the knowledge to be able to properly navigate and use GitHub. 

Communicating with the stakeholders in a project is important in project’s that use the waterfall or Agile Method. The importance of communication with the stakeholders provides the developers with a chance fully understand the requirements of what they’re developing. During the Computer Science program I’ve learned the basics of Agile or Waterfall and how to use each.  

Data Structures and algorithms are important to developers because they are the brains and engine of the software. During the computer sciences program, I’ve learned the basics of how to use, build, and deploy, both algorithms and days data structures. 

Database’s are important because they provide a location to store and pull data from they also serve as a medium where the UI communicates with the code. Within the computer sciences program I’ve learned how to properly manage and create one to one and one to many databases, both mongo and MySQL. 

The Artifacts fit together and demonstrate my knowledge and skill within all of the following areas; improving software, improving data structures, improving databases, improving security, and using data mining. Each section of the required upgrades requires the use of the other pieces of the upgrades. For example, when updating the app to use a 2FA method, it required the updating of data structures to hold other required data, it also required the updating of the databases to add columns to tables, and the expansion of the UI for use.

## Artifact Description
For all three the artifacts that I will be submitting come from an app that I created for my IT-365 class, known as Operating System Environments. The app that I created is called Weight Watcher. Originally, the app tracked the weight of a person, by the input the user puts in, and it allows the user to be able edit and delete any previous inputs, once the user gets to their desired weight, it will give them a notification. What my intentions are for this class, are to extend the app to be able to track body measurements, so the user's can do data mining on their own weights and body measurements.

## Justification For Inclusion
The reason I chose to include this one artifact for use in all three sections of this class is because it gives me the ability to showcase all of my abilities because I created the entire app from the ground up, from the UI design, to the database design and creation, to the combination and implementation of everything together. Because I am the creator of the entire thing this allows me the leverage to be able to add onto it in anyway that I see fit.

## Artifact One: Engineering

### List of upgrades
1. Updating SQL Table to include a column for users phone number. 
2. Created a new view for the execution of the Two Factor Authentication methods.
3. Created new methods in the Database Controller class to execute the Two Factor Authentication. 
4. Added a new line to the registration page to accept the phone number. 

### Demonstrated Skills
1. Create and design creative solutions to address security flaws. 
2. Demonstrate the ability to develop solutions to solve logic problems. 
3. Updating and managing databases.
4. Using, updating, and managing data structures.

### Course Objectives
For the first step I proposed to extend the app by creating and building a form of two factor authentication.

### Reflection
For modifying the artifact I learned a few things. The main thing that I learned is that if your code is too difficult to understand, adding anything to it is almost impossible. I also learned that if you do not write good comments it will also be impossible to fully understand how everything will work. The challenge that I faced was adding a new column within the database.

## Artifact Two: 

### Description
The artifact that I am submitting is called Weight Watcher, it is an app that tracks the weight of a person, and once they get to their desired weight it will give them a notification. The app was created as part of a junior level class that I took.

### List of upgrades
1. Updating SQL Table to include new columns to hold all data from the Measurements class. 
2. Created a new class called Measurements. 
3. Updated the User class to require an object of Measurements.
4. Created A new view called UserInput that takes the users input from measurements they take. 
5. Created new database functions to create/update/delete specific meaurement entries.   

### Demonstrated Skills
1. Demonstrated the ability to develop solutions to solve logic problems. 
3. Updating and managing databases.
4. Using, updating, and managing data structures.
5. Creating and updating User Interfaces.
6. Adding app functionality and complexity. 

### Justification 
The reason why I chose to include this artifact is because it was 100% created by me, and I think it is some of the best coding work that I have done. I believe that the entire app really does demonstrate my abilities, from the UI Design, to the simpleness of the app, and the use and design of the database. The app was improved by adding in a form of a two step authentication, as well as adding in new data structures which will attach to the previous data structures, to enable data mining in the final piece of the project.

### Course Objectives
For the first step I proposed to include the app by introducing a form of two factor authentication, and this week I finished implementing a two factor authentication system as well as included in new data structures.

### Reflection
For modifying the artifact I learned a few things. The main thing that I learned is that if your code is too difficult to understand, adding anything to it is almost impossible. I also learned that if you do not write good comments it will also be impossible to fully understand how everything will work. Lastly, I learned that if you do not have a really modular piece of software, adding anything to it is next to impossible. This week I continued to have difficulties extending the database but eventually ended up getting it.

## Artifact Three:

### Description
The artifact that I am submitting is called Weight Watcher, it is an app that tracks the weight of a person, and once they get to their desired weight it will give them a notification. The app was created as part of a junior level class that I took.

### List of upgrades
1. Added a new view to hold the chart.
2. Incorporated AnyChart API.
3. Connected the API to display data for data mining. 

### Demonstrated Skills
1. Demonstrated the ability to develop solutions to solve logic problems. 
3. Incorporating an API.
4. Using, updating, and managing data structures.
5. Creating and updating User Interfaces.
6. Adding app functionality and complexity. 
7. Providing data mining functionality.

For this week I struggled to use the Gradle system to incorporate the data mining package but ended up getting it.
