# Weight_Watcher
CS 360

<H3>Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?</H3>
The goal of the app was to make a weight tracking app that would allow the person to set their weight and then update their weight as they did more weigh ins.
The user need that was addressed was having an app that tracked their weight loss progress.

<H3>What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?</H3>
All screens were necessary to produced user center UI. The UI design was made simple and also only had information that was relevant to them thus producing user centered UI. The designs were successful 
because each page was based off of the user.

<H3>How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?</H3>
Using MVC was how I decided to approach building the app. I also implemented classes for all othe key components of the app, like users, credentials, databases etc.


<H3>How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?</H3>
I tested the code functionality by continuously running and trying out the most recent code. This process is important because if you code to much without testing you
will eventually create a bug that you don't know where it resides.

<H3>Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?</H3>
I had to innovate by coming up with a way of being able to pass the users name from one screen to the other to be able to consistantly pull up their profiile. 

<H3>In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?</H3>
I was particularly successful in developing an authentication method.
